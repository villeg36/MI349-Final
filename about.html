          <h3>What do I want to do?</h3>
          <p> I have been a student at MSU for 3 years, and during my time here I have been in the world of Engineering because I thought that is what I wanted to do. However, I do not feel the same drive for engineering as I did when I started University. I still have an interest in programming, just not for data science careers or other engineering specifc careers. I am currently looking at other possible careers that might interest me. So I wanted to learn how to design web pages.</p>

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>During this course of Web Development, I struggled with the ability to use Github. The processes and getting things to work feels very overwhelming when looking at it. I struggled with being able to pull when at the terminal and that lead to a lot of set backs when making projects. I found it easier to sometimes make a brand new repo with the files and images added before cloning to VS Code. This is only meant to be how I felt personally using the software. Github has always been an intimidating item to use while i've been programming.</p>

          <h3>Other Interests and Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I live near Detroit and have an interest in film, specifically how directors get the message to the audience through imagery, music, ambient sounds, and overall themes. </p>
