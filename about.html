          <h3>What do I want to do?</h3>
          <p> I have been a student at MSU for 3 years, and during my time here I have been in the world of Engineering because I thought that is what I wanted to do. However, I do not feel the same drive for engineering as I did when I started University. I still have an interest in programming, just not for data science careers or other engineering specifc careers. I am currently looking at other possible careers that might interest me. So I wanted to learn how to design web pages.</p>

          <h3>Time at MSU</h3>
          <p>This is my third year at MSU, but i have only recently switched to the Games and Interactive Media degree. At the moment i am seriously unsure about what it is I want to do beyond college. It makes it hard to want to do anything when I dont have a sense of direction. I dont have any appealing photos of myself. So what i'll provide for you are my amateur parses as a tank for one of World of Warcrafts Raids: Black Wing Lair</p>

          <h3>Other Interests and Hobbies</h3>
          <p>I live near Detroit and have an interest in film, specifically how directors get the message to the audience through imagery, music, ambient sounds, and overall themes. </p>
